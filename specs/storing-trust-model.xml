<title>Model: Anchors and Blacklists</title>

<sect1 id="introduction">
	<title>Introduction</title>

	<para>Various crypto libraries have various ways to represent and store information
		about which Certificate Authorities are to be used as trust anchors. They also
		have different ways to represent certificates that are blacklisted.</para>

	<para>This has led to a poor experience and a lack of coherency on Linux when it
		comes to validating certificates.</para>

	<para>In this document we examine a general purpose method for storing anchor
		certificates, and representing policy about them. We also look at blacklists
		and their peculiarities. We see how we can represent these in a
		coherent and future-proof manner. In addition to being extensible, the proposed concept
		is relatively easy to implement and retrofit into existing code.</para>

	<para>By using consistent anchors and other trust information, crypto libraries
		can make consistent decisions about X.509 certificates.</para>

	<sect2>
		<title>Scope</title>

		<para>We are dealing here with the anchors and other trust policy
			information used by a key or certificate validation algorithm. The algorithm
			itself lives inside of a crypto library implementation. This trust policy
			information can be viewed as input to the certificate validation algorithms.
			We are not dealing with the validation algorithms themselves. These are
			dealt in sufficient detail in the relevant RFCs 
			<footnote><para>Certificate verification is dealt with in detail
			in <ulink url="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt">RFC 5280</ulink>.
			</para></footnote>.
			While in theory it could be nice to have all implementations share common
			code for verification of certificates, imagining such an effort is outside
			the scope of this document. This document does not conflict with such a
			theoretical effort.</para>

		<para>This document attempts to represent basic local trust policy information for X.509
			certificate validation. It does not attempt to tackle the theoretical
			problem of representing all possible forms of digital trust. There are
			many possible flags, profiles and inputs to certificate validation which are
			not represented. Instead this is a common base of information to share, which
			augmented by other application specific information.</para>

		<para>This document currently limits itself to treatment of anchors and blacklisted
			certificates. Later companion documents will deal with pinned keys and shared
			state/storage needed by alternative trust validation implementations.</para>

<sect1 id="concepts">
	<title>Concepts</title>
	<para>Since the words used with these topics are often heavily overloaded and
		some concepts are discussed here.</para>

	<para>A word on terminology. The word <emphasis>trust</emphasis> is used quite a bit
		in this document. This is a highly overloaded and subjective term, and its use
		in this specification is unfortunate. An unambiguous term is desirable.
		The author cringes every time the word <emphasis>trust</emphasis> is used.
		The author cringed a lot while writing this document.</para>

<sect2 id="concept-anchors">
	<title>About Anchors</title>

	<para>X.509 is structured around the concept of having a chain of certificates, each
		of which is signed and therefore trusted by the previous certificate in the
		chain: a certificate authority. These chains are built by crypto libraries
		when validating certificates. They are built in various ways, several of
		which are outlined in RFC 5280.</para>

	<para>At one end of a certificate chain is the <emphasis>end entity</emphasis>
		certificate, which is the certificate that is being validated. At the other
		end the certificate chain is anchored by a trust anchor. This is a public
		key that is explicitly trusted by the local system, either by default or
		by a deliberate configuration choice. Usually this public key is represented
		as a certificate. The anchor is usually, but not always, a root self-signed
		certificate authority.</para>

	<para>Anchors can have <emphasis>trust policy</emphasis>
		<footnote><para>Note we use the term <emphasis>policy</emphasis> here rather
			broadly, and is not limited to the PolicyConstraints certificate
			extension. Rather it includes such concepts as ExtendedKeyUsage,
			NameConstraints, PolicyConstraints, and so on.</para></footnote>
		attached to them which define the situations
		they can be used as anchors. This policy takes on many forms. A given
		anchor might be only be relevant when verifying an end entity certificate
		used for email. Another anchor might be relevant only for an end entity
		certificate that has a Common Name under a certain domain. There are many
		such policies and combinations of them.</para>

	<para>When the anchor public key is represented by a certificate, this trust policy
		is often included in the certificate itself. This is done by use of X.509
		certificate extensions. The email anchor above would have an ExtendedKeyUsage 
			<footnote><para>See RFC 5280 section 4.2.1.12</para></footnote>
		certificate extension included in it. The second anchor above would have a
		NameConstraints
			<footnote><para>See RFC 5280 section 4.2.1.10</para></footnote>
		certificate extension included in it.</para>

	<para>But it very often occurs that the trust policy included with the anchor
		is not present or is not enough. System builders, administrators, and others wish to
		override or adjust the trust policy for a given certificate authority
		especially when used as an anchor. This overridden out-of-band trust policy
		is not included in the anchor itself.</para>

	<para>On Linux there has been no standard way to represent this additional trust
		policy. Various crypto libraries have various of representing this out-of-band
		trust policy, <link linkend="storing-trust-existing">as examined elsewhere</link>.
		This document wishes to define such a standard.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="concept-attached">
	<title>About Attached Extensions</title>

	<para>X.509 certificate extensions usually define the ways that a certificate
		can be used to represent trust policy. Usually these
		certificate extensions are internal to the certificate, and are signed
		by the issuer of the certificate.</para>

	<para>By associating additional certificate extensions to a public key or
		X.509 certificate we can represent out-of-band trust policy, as defined
		by a system builder, administrator or user.</para>

	<para>We will refer to these additional extensions as <emphasis>Attached
		Extensions</emphasis>.</para>

	<para>When both standard X.509 certificate extensions and attached extensions are
		present, the attached extension is to be used instead of the certificate
		extension with the same OID in the certificate itself. In this way attached
		certificate extensions override policy defined in the certificate, if any.</para>

	<para>This has the implication that if only one portion of a certificate extension
		needs to be adjusted by a attached certificate extension, that entire
		extension will be overridden for that certificate. This is intentional. Each extension
		that contains trust policy should be treated as a whole unit of trust
		policy. This includes changing the critical field of an extension.
		This is part of the whole.</para>

	<para>For each certificate, there may not be more than one attached certificate extension of a given
		identifier or type. There is no way to automatically merge certificate
		extensions. It may be possible for applications which store attached
		certificate extensions (such as a management interface) to merge certain
		extensions in some way. However that is out of the scope of this
		document.</para>

	<para>Attached certificate extensions are associated with the subject public key info
		of the anchor or certificate.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="concept-blacklist">
	<title>About Blacklisting and Revocation</title>

	<para>A blacklisted key or certificate is one that should be rejected outright
		when it is encountered in a validation algorithm.</para>

	<para>As designed, when an X.509 certificate is compromised, either through malice
		or accident, it is supposed to be revoked. Verification algorithms check against
		lists of revoked certificates published by certificate authorities in
		standard ways.</para>

	<para>When an anchor certificate is revoked, or revocation needs to take place
		independent of the certificate authority, such a certificate is added to
		a blacklist. This is a separate mechanism from the certificate revocation
		lists outlined in X.509.</para>

	<para>Blacklists are distributed by system builders or administrators. They are
		used as a supplement to retrieved revocation lists, and dynamic protocols
		such as OCSP and OCSP Stapling.</para>

	<para>On Linux there has been no standard way to represent blacklists. Various
		crypto libraries have various means of representing them, and
		<link linkend="storing-trust-existing">we examine them elsewhere</link>.
		This document wishes to define a such a standard.</para>
</sect2>

<sect1 id="model">
	<title>Model</title>

	<para>Over the years there have been many ways that anchors and
		blacklists have been represented. It is clear that none of the
		<link linkend="storing-trust-existing">examined representations</link>
		serve to comprehensively model the necessary trust information.</para>

	<para>Here we discuss a stored model which can be used to store,
		lookup, and share (between implementations) anchors and blacklists.
		The model is generic in nature and defines the characteristics
		that actual APIs and formats should have.</para>

	<para>Actual APIs for accessing this model are defined in companion
		documents.</para>

<sect2 id="model-store">

<sect2 id="model-layering">
	<title>Store Layering</title>

	<para>Implementations may have multiple stores, each containing the above sets.
	For example one store may be a read-only system store, and another store may
	be one editable by the user. Implementations should have a defined order of
	lookup priority for these multiple stores.</para>

	<para>Callers performing a lookup operation should perform the lookup against
	each store in turn, using the defined order. Once the lookup operation returns
	results against a store, it should not continue to on to lower priority stores.
	In this way items in higher priority stores override information in lower
	priority stores.</para>

	<para>If a public key or certificate is both in the set of anchors and the
	blacklist set, then the caller should treat it as black listed. This means that both
	the anchors and blacklist sets in a given store should be consulted when
	validating certificates or keys. However again, as noted above, once a store
	returns results for a key, stores with a lower priority should not be consulted
	for trust information about that key.</para>
