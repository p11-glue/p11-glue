<h1>Project: Trust Storage Module</h1>

<p>This is a PKCS#11 module that exposes read-only storage of system
certificates and trust policy. It loads the certificates and trust
storage from a directory of files.</p>

<p>Crypto libraries are able to use this as a shared source of certificate
authority anchors, black lists, and other locally stored system trust policy.</p>

<p>There is work going on to define a comprehensive representation of
this <a href="sharing-trust-policy.html">shared trust policy</a>. Once such a
solution matures we hope to implement it in this PKCS#11 trust storage module.</p>

<p>Also included is a tool called <tt>p11-kit extract-trust</tt> that can be used
to extract certificates anchors with trust information in various formats for
crypto libraries not (or not yet) able to read from this PKCS#11 trust module
directly.</p>

<p>A goal is to have minimal dependencies, and be crypto library agnostic so this
can be used by any library or app. Accesses information owned by root and configured
by a system administrator or distro creator. These PKCS#11 objects are read-only
and so don't need to go through a coordinating daemon. Thus we can implement an
efficient, reliable lookup for these system certs and other objects, with less
moving parts.</p>

<h2>Source Repository</h2>

<p>Code has been merged into the main p11-kit repository, and is found in
the <tt>trust/</tt> subdirectory. The extract code is found in the <tt>tools</tt>
subdirectory:</p>

<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/p11-glue/p11-kit
$ cd p11-kit
</pre>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>An implementation of the module is available, and you can try it out. A dependency
on libtasn1-devel is required to build the PKCS#11 trust module. The extract
tool is also implemented.</p>

<pre>
$ sh autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --libdir=/usr/lib64 --enable-debug \
	--with-trust-paths=/etc/pki/ca-trust/source:/usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo mv -v /usr/lib64/libnssckbi.so /opt/libnssckbi.so.orig-nss
$ sudo ln -sv pkcs11/p11-kit-trust.so /usr/lib64/libnssckbi.so
</pre>

<p>Now place some certificates in the <tt>--with-trust-paths</tt> location(s).
Right now, as input, you can use DER, PEM or OpenSSL style 'trusted
certificates'.</p>

<p>For example you can tweak some trust policy bits like so:</p>

<pre>
$ openssl x509 -addtrust serverAuth -addreject clientAuth \
	-in /path/to/my-ca.pem -out /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/my-ca.pem
</pre>

<p>Now you can run apps like Firefox and see the certificates appear in the
Certificate manager and are trusted as appropriate. You can use a command like
this to see some debug output:</p>

<pre>
$ P11_KIT_DEBUG=all firefox
</pre>

<p>Run the extraction tool, and/or customize it:</p>

<pre>
$ p11-kit extract-trust
</pre>
